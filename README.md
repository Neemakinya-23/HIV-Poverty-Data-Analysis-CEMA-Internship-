# HIV & Poverty Data Analysis â€“ CEMA Internship Task

This project investigates the relationship between HIV prevalence and multidimensional poverty across Sub-Saharan African countries. It was developed as part of a task for the CEMA Internship Program, with the goal of extracting actionable insights from public health and economic data.

## Objective
To identify countries contributing to over 75% of the global HIV burden, visualize prevalence trends, and explore the impact of poverty on HIV outcomes using real-world datasets.

## Key Features
- Cleaned and merged multi-source data from WHO, World Bank, and UN datasets
- Identified and ranked countries by HIV burden and poverty index
- Created visualizations using `ggplot2` to show trends in HIV, poverty, and mortality
- Mapped regional disparities in under-five and neonatal mortality using shapefiles and geospatial plotting
- Compiled all insights into an R Markdown report

##Tools & Technologies
- **R**: Data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis  
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization  
- **dplyr**, **tidyr**, **readr**: Data transformation  
- **sf**, **GADM shapefiles**: Mapping and geospatial data  
- **R Markdown**: Reporting and documentation

## Skills Gained
- Handling large public health datasets
- Visual storytelling through graphs and maps
- Geospatial mapping with shapefiles
- Integrating statistical analysis with policy-relevant reporting

## Structure
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets  
- `scripts/`: R scripts for cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- `report/`: R Markdown report with visuals and interpretations  
- `README.md`: Project overview (this file)

## Notes
Though this project was not selected in the final round, it was an incredible learning experience in real-world data analysis, and demonstrates my growing expertise in data science for social impact. It was a learning curve.
